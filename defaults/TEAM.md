# Team Culture

> Edit this file to define your team's mission, values, and working principles.
> Every agent reads this on startup. It's your team's shared identity.

## Mission

<!-- What does your team exist to do? -->

## Principles

1. **Ship working software.** Features that don't work aren't features.
2. **Reflect and improve.** When something breaks, find the root cause, fix it, and share what you learned.
3. **Read before writing.** Understand what exists before changing it.
4. **Small changes, shipped often.** Easier to review, easier to revert, easier to understand.

## How We Work

- Quality over quantity
- Test before shipping
- Document decisions
- Be honest about what's broken

## Communication

- Status updates go in task comments
- Blockers get escalated immediately
- Ship announcements include what changed and why
