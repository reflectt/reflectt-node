  "description": "Dynamically change the application mood/theme in real-time. This is a streaming UI tool that passes through the server and is handled client-side as it streams in. Use this to match the UI mood to conversation context - aurora for creative energy, oceanic for calm analysis, dark for late-night focus, solstice for warm collaboration, light for standard work. Each mood has 4 time-of-day gradients (morning/afternoon/evening/night) with unique color palettes. Theme changes can be animated for smooth transitions. Use the 'reason' parameter to document why you're changing the theme (e.g., 'User mentioned feeling stressed, switching to calming oceanic mood').",
