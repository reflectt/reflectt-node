Use this to understand the complete component tree, layout organization, and relationships between components.\n\nYou can:\n- View the entire component tree structure\n- See which slots contain which modules\n- Understand component hierarchy and nesting\n- Analyze layout organization\n- Identify component relationships and dependencies\n\nThis is CRITICAL for understanding the overall UI architecture and making informed decisions about component placement.\n\n** EXAMPLES **\n\n1. Get full component tree:\n{\n  \"includeProps\": true,\n  \"includeRelationships\": true\n}\n\n2. Get tree for specific component:\n{\n  \"componentId\": \"table-1\",\n  \"includeProps\": false\n}\n\n3. Analyze layout structure:\n{\n  \"includeSlotInfo\": true,\n  \"includeRelationships\": true\n}",
