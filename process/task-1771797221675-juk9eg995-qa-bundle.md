# QA Bundle — task-1771797221675-juk9eg995

## Summary
Auto-close reconciled validating tasks in the execution sweeper to prevent SLA escalation noise.

## Changes
- `src/executionSweeper.ts`
  - `isAutoClosable()`: checks metadata.reconciled + reviewer approval + PR merge status
  - `sweepValidatingQueue()`: auto-closes eligible tasks before SLA loop; filters them from escalation
  - Chat notification on auto-close for visibility
  - `SweepResult.autoClosedCount` added

- `tests/auto-close-reconciled.test.ts`
  - 7 tests covering: reconciled+approved, review_state approved, merged PR, unmerged PR blocks, non-reconciled blocks, unapproved blocks, regression scenario

## Evidence
- `npm test` → 51 files, 868 passed, 1 skipped

## How to Validate
1. Create a task with `metadata.reconciled=true, reviewer_approved=true, status=validating`
2. Run sweeper (or wait for interval)
3. Confirm task auto-transitions to `done` with `auto_closed=true`
4. Confirm SLA sweeper does NOT fire breach alerts for that task

## Caveats
- Only affects reconciled + approved tasks with no unmerged PR
- Non-reconciled tasks and unapproved tasks are completely unaffected
