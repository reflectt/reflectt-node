# TASK-rcuuep9co — lane/surface metadata warnings + routing guardrail

This task is **superseded** by merged PR #463.

PR: https://github.com/reflectt/reflectt-node/pull/463

What shipped in #463:
- Routing guardrail is config-driven via TEAM-ROLES.yaml (role/lane/surface/tags)
- Warn-only lane/surface hints in task creation + precheck
- Applied to both assignee suggestion and reviewer autosuggest
- Regression tests + docs (`docs/LANE_SURFACE_ROUTING.md`)

Close reason: duplicate/superseded by #463.
