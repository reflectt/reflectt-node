# QA Bundle — task-1771797224266-63x6no84b

## Summary
Schema migration coverage hardening for the reflection/insight pipeline. 5 deterministic tests covering insight→task linkage across all DB upgrade paths, plus operator-facing migration compatibility runbook.

## Changes
- `tests/schema-migration.test.ts` — 5 tests
- `docs/runbooks/schema-migration-compatibility.md` — operator runbook

## Evidence
- `npm test` → 53 files, 874 passed, 1 skipped
- Regression test reproduces exact prior failure mode

## Caveats
- Tests simulate DB states using raw SQL (not the full `runMigrations` function) to isolate specific version transitions. This is intentional for deterministic testing.
