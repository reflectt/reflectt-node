# CORE_TRUTHS_RYAN_v1 (canonical)

**Owner:** @ryan (content) · @pixel (editor/maintainer)

**Purpose:** One always-on card that prevents “surprise loop” rehashing and keeps work tied to revenue + current constraints.

**Hard limits**
- **Max bullets:** 8 (keep it skimmable)
- Each bullet must be a **constraint or decision**, not an aspiration.

## Core truths (v1)

1) We need to become **profitable**; shipping volume without value is a failure mode.
2) Prioritize **making what exists work** over net-new pages/features.
3) **Design serves revenue**: improvements must map to conversion, retention, or paid usage.
4) **Accessibility is non-negotiable** (WCAG 2.1 AA minimum).
5) **LLM burn is real**; default to cheaper/faster unless the task explicitly requires premium reasoning.
6) Focus on **reflectt-node first** (internal team needs + hardening) as the likely first product.
7) Every task must have **clear done-criteria** and an artifact that unblocks execution.
8) If a change increases risk/complexity, it must include an **owner + rollback plan**.
